# Melbourne-House-Price

Author: Adedayo K. Adebayo


A simple model is built using the Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv data set for predicting house price in Melbourne. This project is organized as follows: 
(a) data preprocessing and variable selection; 
(b) basic regression model; 
(c) hyper-parameters tuning; and 
(d) techniques for dimensionality reduction.

cruise_ship_info.csv: dataset used for model building.

Ship_Crew_Size_ML_Model.ipynb: the Jupyter notebook containing code.
